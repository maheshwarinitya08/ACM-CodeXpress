/* Day 13: Missing Player
During the Cricket World Cup, each participating team is assigned a unique jersey number for their players. The jersey numbers range from 0 to n, where n is the total number of players in the team. The numbers are assigned in a consecutive manner without any duplicates.

You are given an array jerseyNumbers of n elements representing the jersey numbers of the players in a particular team. However, one player's jersey number is missing. Can you write a program to find the missing jersey number?

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase will provide n.
The second line of each testcase will be an array jerseyNumbers of n elements.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
1<=n<=10,000
All elements in jerseyNumbers are distinct and are within range of 0 to n (inclusive).
Output Format

For each testcase out the missing player's jersey Number.
Sample Input 0

1
3
3 0 1
Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in jerseyNumbers.

Sample Input 1

1
2
0 1
Sample Output 1

2
Explanation 1

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in jerseyNumbers.*/
